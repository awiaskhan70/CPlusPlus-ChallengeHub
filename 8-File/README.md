### Topic 8: File I/O

**Challenge:**

Create a C++ program that reads and writes data to a file. Here are the requirements:

1. Create a class called `Student` with the following attributes:
   - `studentId` (integer)
   - `name` (string)
   - `grade` (double)

2. Provide member functions to set and get these attributes.

3. In the `main` function, create an array of `Student` objects with a size of 5.

4. Prompt the user to input data for each student (student ID, name, and grade) and store it in the array.

5. Write the data for all the students to a text file named "students.txt". Each line in the file should represent one student's data in the format: "studentId name grade".

6. Read the data from the "students.txt" file and display it on the console.

This challenge will test your understanding of classes, file I/O, and working with arrays.
