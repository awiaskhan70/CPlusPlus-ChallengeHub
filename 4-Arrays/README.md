### Topic 4: Arrays

**Explanation:**
In C++, an array is a collection of elements of the same data type. You can access elements in an array using their index.

**Challenge:**
Write a C++ program that does the following:

1. Declare an integer array of size 5.
2. Use a loop to input 5 integers from the user and store them in the array.
3. Use another loop to print the elements of the array.

Here's a basic outline to get you started:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    const int arraySize = 5;
    int myArray[arraySize];

    // Input 5 integers into the array

    // Print the elements of the array

    return 0;
}
```
