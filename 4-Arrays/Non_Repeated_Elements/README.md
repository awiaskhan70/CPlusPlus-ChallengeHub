Write a C++ function to find all the elements in an integer array that are not repeated. Each element that appears exactly once in the array should be returned in the order they first appeared. If no such elements exist, the function should return an empty list.

### Requirements:
- The function should be optimized for readability and performance.
- Consider both space and time complexities of your solution.

### Example:
Input array: [4, 3, 9, 4, 3, 9, 5, 5, 2]
Output: [2]
Here, only the number 2 is not repeated in the array.

### Additional Test Cases:
Input: [6, 1, 3, 3, 6, 6, 2]
Output: [1, 2]

Input: [7, 7, 7, 7]
Output: [] (empty list as there are no non-repeated elements)

Input: []
Output: []
