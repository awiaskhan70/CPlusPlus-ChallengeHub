Topic 2: User Input and Basic Control Structures
Explanation:
In C++, you can take user input using cin and use basic control structures like if and else for decision-making.

Challenge:
Write a C++ program that takes an integer as input from the user and checks if it's even or odd. If it's even, print "Even," and if it's odd, print "Odd."
