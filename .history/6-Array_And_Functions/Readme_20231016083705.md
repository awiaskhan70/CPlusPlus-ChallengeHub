### Topic 6: Arrays and Functions

**Challenge:**

Write a C++ program that does the following:

1. Define a function called `findMax` that takes an integer array and its size as arguments and returns the maximum value in the array.

2. Define another function called `findMin` that takes an integer array and its size as arguments and returns the minimum value in the array.

3. In the `main` function, declare an integer array of size 10 and populate it with random numbers (you can use the `rand()` function from the `<cstdlib>` header).

4. Use the `findMax` and `findMin` functions to find and print the maximum and minimum values in the array.

This challenge will require you to work with arrays, functions, and random number generation.
