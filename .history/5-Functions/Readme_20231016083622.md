### Topic 5: Functions

**Explanation:**
In C++, functions are reusable blocks of code that perform specific tasks. They help in organizing code, making it more modular and easier to maintain.

**Challenge 1:**
Write a C++ program that defines a function called `isEven` that takes an integer as an argument and returns `true` if the integer is even and `false` if it's odd. Then, use this function to check if numbers from 1 to 10 are even or odd and print the results.

**Challenge 2:**
Write a C++ program that defines a function called `calculateSum` that takes an integer `n` as an argument and returns the sum of all numbers from 1 to `n`. Use this function to calculate and print the sum of numbers from 1 to 100.

Here's an outline to get you started:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

// Define the functions here

int main() {
    // Use the functions to solve the challenges

    return 0;
}
```
