Topic 1: Variables and Data Types
Explanation:
In C++, variables are used to store data. C++ has several built-in data types to represent different kinds of values. 
Common data types include int for integers, double for floating-point numbers, char for characters, and bool for Boolean values.

Challenge:
Write a C++ program that declares and initializes variables of different data types (e.g., int, double, char, bool) and prints their values.
