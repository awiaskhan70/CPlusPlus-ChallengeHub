### Topic 7: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

**Challenge:**

Implement a basic object-oriented program in C++ to simulate a simple bank account. Here are the requirements:

1. Create a `BankAccount` class with the following attributes:
   - `accountNumber` (integer)
   - `accountHolderName` (string)
   - `balance` (double)

2. Provide the following member functions for the `BankAccount` class:
   - A constructor to initialize the account with an account number, account holder name, and an initial balance.
   - `getAccountNumber()` to get the account number.
   - `getAccountHolderName()` to get the account holder's name.
   - `getBalance()` to get the account balance.
   - `deposit(double amount)` to deposit money into the account.
   - `withdraw(double amount)` to withdraw money from the account (ensure that the balance doesn't go negative).

3. In the `main` function, create two instances of `BankAccount`, perform some deposits and withdrawals on them, and display the account details after each transaction.

This challenge will give you practice in creating a class, defining its member functions, and working with objects.
