**Challenge 11: Data Structures and Algorithms - Linked List**

**Objective:**
- Implement a linked list data structure in C++ and perform basic operations on it.

**Requirements:**
1. Create a C++ program that defines a linked list class. The linked list should have nodes, and each node should contain an integer value.

2. Implement the following basic operations for the linked list:
   - Insertion: You should be able to insert a node at the beginning, end, or any specific position in the linked list.
   - Deletion: You should be able to delete a node from the linked list based on its value or position.
   - Search: Implement a function to search for a specific value in the linked list.
   - Display: Create a function to display the contents of the linked list.

3. Write a main program that demonstrates the use of the linked list class by performing these operations.

4. Use dynamic memory allocation (new/delete) to manage the nodes in the linked list.

This challenge will introduce you to the concept of linked lists, a fundamental data structure. It's a stepping stone for understanding more complex data structures and algorithms.
