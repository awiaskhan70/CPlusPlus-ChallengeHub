Topic 3: Loops (for and while)
Explanation:
In C++, loops are used to repeatedly execute a block of code. Two common types of loops are the 'for' loop and the 'while' loop.

Challenge 1:
Write a C++ program that uses a for loop to print the numbers from 1 to 10.

Challenge 2:
Write a C++ program that uses a while loop to find the sum of all even numbers from 1 to 100.
